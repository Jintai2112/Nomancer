What is Portcullis?

Portcullis follows the story of a group of characters from their childhood into their adult life. The characters are grown through their experiences, and the system reflects this. There are no archetypes or experience points...instead you are rewarded for practicing Skills and playing to your character's dispositions.

It is a story of the characters' relationships with each other, as well as their interactions with their Darkness, Ambitions, Instincts and Fears.

While there is a storyline, much of the game is about your character's inclinations, and where they take the story.

See How to Make a Background, How to Make a Character Sheet and How to Play Portcullis for more information.

How to play Portcullis

Portcullis is a TTRPG and plays as one, though it is focused more on collaborative storytelling than on detailed combat. The storyteller describes the environment and other characters, while the players focus on their own characters.

The number one objective should be staying alive and sane! Keep an eye on your Energy Pools and maintain them wisely; the setting is a world full of mind-bending magic and mortal danger...using Skills drains energy, but so does Damage, Injuries and Wounds .

The second objective should be in completing Ambitions, which will lead to Fame, fortune and, as a by product, Improving Skills.

To ensure these objectives, conflict (perhaps in the form of Combat) will certainly take place. This could stain a character's soul with Darkness. These conflicts will be shaped by Instincts and Fears.

Opportunities and Tragedies will help ensure success, but remember that death and madness are just around the corner for every Nomancer.

This campaign incorporates solo and split party play - and will have an element of play by post, where players can take actions via messaging me out of game. This will compensate for individual's ambitions, as well as real life commitments that prevent everyone from playing at the same time. The email address to do this on is Nomancer.portcullis@gmail.com.

How to Make a Character Sheet

During character creation, in one category of Skills (Physical, Mental or Social) you can spend 3 points, in another 2 points and in the last one 1 point. These are then used to calculate Energy Pools (see Physical Energy Pool, Mental Energy Pool and Social Energy Pool). See Improving Skills to learn how to gain more skill ranks.

You also need to set your Instincts and Fears. These choices will begin to form your background (see How to Make a Background).

Lastly, put these on your section of PLAYER CHARACTERS.

How to Make a Background

To make a background in Portcullis is fairly easy (though it should take longer than to make a new character) as some necessary parts of character creation will see that it is at least mostly complete anyway. These are Instincts, Fears  and Skills. Choose 3 Instincts and 3 Fears.

You also need to set where you are from (see Cultures), who your friends and family were (perhaps shaping your Skills), important events that may have influenced you (that may explain your Instincts and Fears), your appearance, mannerisms and exact age (though every new character is somewhere between 5 and 8). You may also work with the storyteller to determine one ambition (see Ambitions), though this is not necessary and there will be plenty of time for that at a later time.

Next you have to decide why you are travelling to The Myriad; whether your parents have paid for the education, whether you have a mysterious sponsor, The Myriad have noticed your promise, a case of mistaken identity or some other reason.

If you have not already done so, go to How to Make a Character Sheet. Otherwise put these on your section of PLAYER CHARACTERS and go to How to Play Portcullis.

Injuries and Death

Injuries

If a character has no dice left in the pool, or  damage equals or exceeds a relavent pool maximum, they are rendered unable to continue with the current encounter. They may be able to flee, but generally only with assistance.

They are now wounded (physical), marred (social), or drained (mental). These are all injuries. After the encounter, the character is no longer useless but still has their injury. A character can accumulate multiple injuries of each type.

If  wounded, and physical damage equals or exceeds the physical pool maximum, they may die. If  drained or marred and damage equals or exceeds mental or social respectively, then the character may go permanently mad (and unplayable).

Dying

For every round in an encounter that you have received at least one new injury, roll a D20. If the result is equal to or less than new total of injuries that you have, you die or go mad (the exact result depends on the injury that you have recieved). When the injured character can be considered safe from threat, they may stop rolling the D20.

If a character has eithermax damage, or no dice in any poolto, they are dead.

Injuries can be healed. This can be achieved only via Ambitions - whether it is the character's ambition to get themself better, or another character who wants to heal them.  Some injuries that have gone untreated for too long may become unhealable.

Damage

Damage = the difference of successes in an opposed roll. The loser takes damage to whichever of  Energy Pools that the winner used for their roll,  (eg if the attacker used a physical attack, you take physical damage). This is recorded as 'damage'.

See Degrees of Success and Order of Combat for more information on opposed rolls. See Injury and Death for more on damage.

Energy Pools

Old Sarian: Old Saria is a wider cultural group that occupies the eastern side of Sarania. They lean towards Immortalism; a set of folk beliefs that those who dedicate their lives to heroic acts come back as immortals after death

Noble women hold the most status, are the highest social class, and most live in the cities and belong to conclaves; guilds dedicated to their members perfecting the art that they are aligned to.

Noble born men are generally warders; those who take payment to father and raise children for the women of the conclaves. They wear the garb of the kilt to be ecognizable in their role. If it is a girl, their training is due to be geared towards the mother’s conclave. If it is a boy, then it is geared towards being a warder – and thus never knowing their mother. When the child reaches their 18th birthday they graduate, and whether boy or girl, the mother is to pay the warder their wages in one (prearranged) lump sum. This should be enough to retire upon comfortably. Due to this, warders loathe to risk those that they sire, but generally after payment they will part ways.

The warder may train multiple wards at once, fulfilling multiple contracts, with the same or different women.

It is the norm for warders to be nomadic, travelling from one place to the next in order to find new experiences for their wards.

Regulars are the middle social class. Regulars are those who do not find their way into conclaves, or who are not suited to warding, become the farmers, traders and foot soldiers of a city state. As with nobles, there isn’t the concept of the family unit in regular society. If a woman falls pregnant, and once the child has weened, they are given to the father to raise.

The lowest social class are called cobbles.  They fill other roles in society. They do the cleaning and the labouring. They also make up the majority of the criminal element. Infact, those who commit petty crimes are punished with having their jobs and possessions taken by the city, which makes them a cobble.

Cobbles are free to form family units without judgment, which makes them numerable, but are forbidden to own anything. This is enforced by the regulars; if a cobble has something, then usually it is taken. They are also required to wear hooded gowns.

New Sarian: New Saria is a wider cultural group that occupies the western side of Sarania. They lean towards the Temple; an organised religion claiming to be the original religion of the now fallen original Sarian Empire.

In New Saria, there is slightly less distinction between nobles and regulars. Noble women hold more status than men, as in Old Saria. The conclaves do, however, take in men in some circumstances, and men (as well as some women) live as the eastern warders.

 In this culture, however, they are called drifters, and rather than being employed, if they can seduce a member of the opposite sex, they can raise their child. On the child’s 18th birthday, they are due payment. This is enforced by the representatives of Temple (often warrior priests travelling from Bayala) and failure of adequate payment results in all possessions being given to the wronged drifter (and thus becoming a cobble).

Regulars can also become drifters (cobbles are still excluded) and it is a popular method for trying to gain one’s riches. Drifters often form communities and help raise each other’s children. In New Saria, drifter communities are more commonly the criminal element, and are mistrusted by the conclaves.

Members of the lowest social class are called cobbles. Cobbles in New Saria are allowed to have possessions, but they themselves are owned by conclaves and selectively bred. The best stock are known as Finedraws, and are often sold to Temple, or occasionally the Myriad for very large sums of money. Sometimes skilled Old Sarian warders are employed by women of such a conclave, and they discard the child, secretly swapping it for a finedraw. This enables more effective prodigies and a more powerful conclave…this practice is more common that one might think.

Non Sarian: 

There are 3 subcultures within the Old Sarian culture, as is listed with descriptions in the bullet points below.

Bayala: The Bayalan cities are famous across Old Saria due to the common belief in the teachings of the Temple of the Saria – the organised religion said to have been the religion of the Originators. Many conclaves train warrior priests for Temple. The most famous city state for this is Jeda, who are said to produce the most devout in all of Sarania

Their cities are generally ruled by holy women (or occasionally men) appointed by Temple.

Bayalans have an icy relationship with the Ralans for this reason, despite their culture overlapping in so many other ways, and so many Bayalan warders would rather travel west to Kombika and Nygina to meet women to employ them.

The Bayalans eat a lot of game, and it is fashionable to coat them in New Saranian spices. The sport which surrounds hunting has led to conclaves dedicated to both breeding programs of animals and developing master huntresses.

They favor the spear and the bow in Bayala, for gathering food as well as for combat. In the villages, Ramaheali – the art of the high spear is taught. It involves using the spear to aid in mobility and aerial attacks. 

Example Bayalan unisex names include: Ibhosh ayalaidfa bzim ajo, Ye’ ayalaibgha’, Rub jmi ayalanudrchi, Anyaz yalajubshio, Abs’d ayalnuyu barau, Lafe jleh a bayalahbi ddere, Asash ayalabgez, Osud’ ayreye’, Laubsh yalalayashli, ashai yalrugab, Adfabai bay da aher ao, Gi il ar yanyu ba’jo, Nubishche ayamwzyo, Anfebo ayashube, Ada jlehute ayahosh, Ombish yaisdaby, Asyu ba’ ayalosubshi, Mafa deae ayabsh ylahe, Nudbre yalahgi chirure, Magiryo aynuaztu, Rea rhato anagir, Mayer ayamoya’che, Omo klemucha yaluhazj, Juhoshyu yalanafab, Lagi’ yamwb, Ahfa ddin a baisfab, Azwb aynugi tei, Layu bash ynufa rzim a, Idha lzimu ayalaibash, Gishbo bayaruye’, mu’ie yanasa bhato, Abbish ayamufashde, Anyebch arehozya, Omgibi ayaljamushle, Lufar bayaluha liloiu.

 

Ralan: The Ralan view themselves as paragons of both modesty and virtue. For most, it is their path to Immortality, and will often punish themselves and others for violating their spiritual quest. Many non-Ralan’s view them with contempt. Always trust a Ralan, but never with one’s name. Is a common saying, meaning they are the most trustworthy but it is wise to fear their judgment.

Their cities are generally ruled by the Jinali – a Immortalist sect of highly spiritual women.

Their conclaves include the best when it comes to self discipline, and they are famed for conclaves dedicated to training animals.  Ralans are often sought after by the Myriad as they are suited to the rigors of study. The food they eat is fairly bland but highly nutritious. It is composed of many root vegetables and large insects cooked in soups. They use animals in a multitude of ways; herbivores and those who eat insects to find their food underground, and carnivores such as tigers for warfare. It is taboo to eat an animal that can be worked.

Regulars operate through the contract between woman and warder, much like the nobles of other Old Sarian cultures, and so this is an even more central feature of their society. To set themselves apart, noble warders are given one or more gaes when they come of age by the local Jinali – an obligation or taboo that will define their destiny. It is said that the more gaes one has, the greater the destiny.

The Ralan favor the bow for its efficiency, and the great sword as a weapon of honour. Example Ralan unisex names include: As’il alanibshleh, Mushman aluzhad, Molim raludshil, Am’lem anru’man, Jurher ralaib’, Ruzhat ralanmozlim, Jazder rallashlah, Reshlim arelah, Gabhad ralanisshlem, Lahat ralombhat, Ruhat lanahzdin, Rubhat anoslim, Rurhir ralanazzhad, Ju’eem lanla’mi, Nudin ralomil, Lu ralanadmi, Asb ralaisblah, Mablah alanis’lim, Abshzim ralanja’leh, Isshir ralrurder, Narhat ralanabzher, Oszlim ralanreshil, Relim ranurhir, Azzhir ralanmoshlim, Osrlim ralararder, Omrder ralmashlah, Larder ralanjurzim, Oszman anaz, Mabhat ralarushlem, Luzeem ahzmi, shlem anibher, Jarmi ralanisshman, Abz ralanmu’mi, Muher lanibdin, Rebzim aju’man, Ibreem lanib’hat, Ab raru’lem, Asbhat a bdin, Ahrdin lan shlem, Amrleh ralamshad, Nushir amablem, Rebhat anmorlem, Mu rareder, Aszleh lanabzeem, Nuz ralajurher, Nuzdin alanasbher, Jubder anid’, Muhat anadzmi, Ralah ralaidlim, Adbman ralreblem, Hobzim anjabhad, Ahder ranshlem, Mozhad ralanu’had, Rerlem alanahbher, Ru’her ajaher, Moshil ralananbmi, Oslah ralaruzhir, Abshlah ralmobzim, Abrzim alanrehad, Ru’her alanjabzim, Ud’din ralrublah, Abrlim abher, Mabmi adzher, Abrdin ralmushil, Ombdin ralidzhat, Jarhad areil, Am’man ralarmi, Mobzim langhablem, Mobhat ralanbosher, Razdin ralanshzim, Marlah ralajubeem.

Yuta: The Yuta are the most adventurous of Old Saria. Their warders are the most travelled, and their conclaves are famous for their artistry that depicts great deeds. This is mostly through intricate carving, blacksmithing and masonry, but also through dance and painting. Some even train in music, though this is done away from prying ears!

For inspiration, women will often travel with their warders. Romance is therefore more common between woman and warder, but the family unit is still very rare.

Most Yuta, even regulars, seek death through glory for glory’s sake – Immortality is simply a convenient by product. Men and women love a duel over matters of the heart – especially the nobles. In fact, many of the kings and queens of Yutan city states became so through dueling the previous monarch to the death – a valid and holy way of gaining the throne. The Yuta favor duel wielding carp’s tongue swords, which are revered and passed down the female line in most cases.

Their duels (and battle) are often met while under the influence of narcotic and medicinal herbs. There are many types of these herbs, and many have bold flavours that are used in their exciting curries that they eat with copious amounts of sweet breads. The Yuta are voracious eaters and will travel at great lengths to excite their pallet, and many have died in the Fiery Forest while trying to trade with the Kombika for spices, or trying to hunt the immoparous crocodiles that live there in the vast flooded caverns.

Example male Yutan names include: Spark ibbzim aosrlim of the indigo gifted tree, Knife ksalem ahzim of the green wanton knife, Zeal xa’din yutmormi of the blue spirited heavens, Master anz tamzzim of the lime salacious woman, Honour azzeem yujasheem of the hungry unparalleled rain, Honour isblem yutaluzlem of the teal sudden tree, Sword ib’lem yuanshleh of the teal flaming tree, Honour rublah utabhat of the wonderous fast weapon, Rock xazdin yutabshil of the celebrated salacious brand, Spear ibbil utaosshman of the black perfected gifts, Trust aheem yuam’lim of the profane fast lizard, Knife bib aibrhad of the blue passionate weapon, Spear adher yuruhat of the blue gorgeous sabre, Spear rashdin yuazbhir of the gold quick tent, Carving ambzim yutasshad of the gold lightning tree, Hammer isshdin tajublim of the green flaming heavens, Rock asbeem utarebeem of the green electric mount, Keen rareem taraman of the blue fleeting tree, Rock ruzlah yuluzman of the tempestuous unbridled lizard, Skull xasheem yutlu’had of the celebrated fervent sun, Sword rablim yuibshir of the yellow unbroken bosom, Knife anbeem tarubdin of the blue great bosom, Honesty ruil utarebeem of the giant salacious tent, Trust ad’lim yutaisder of the white poetic bosom, Zeal ahbdin utamozhat of the tempestuous impulsive bosom, Hammer ambdin yutaibrder of the blue spirited cleaver, Carving amreem taibbleh of the violet gifted weapon, Metal anzlim yutibil of the grey beautiful painting, Honesty iszmi yutanashlim of the blue unbroken sun, Spark anzdin aidb of the green cunning blade.

There are 2 subcultures within the New Sarian culture, as is listed with descriptions in the bullet points below.

Kombika: The Kombika have two rough subgroups, which are listed with descriptions in the bullet points below.  

 The Western Kombika: The Western Kombika mostly live in the warmth of the Wetwood. The rains cause food to be abundant (if you like fungus for three meals a day) and they spend a lot of time indoors. The conclaves of West Kombika are very isolationist and mistrusting of everyone else. The conclaves have therefore developed the deadliest of arts – too many to list. This has led to them being the most militant of people, and the most in need of good entertainment. This is usually sought through sex and death. Cobbles with poor breeding often find their way to the underground fighting arenas (The Pambana), and plots to kill colleagues and enemies alike are considered good sport. Women and men alike will often accept known drifters into their bed, seeking to kill them once they are done with them. Drifters of Western Kombika are aware of this game and seek to escape and live long enough to receive payment (which in West Kombika is set at half one’s wealth). This is known as the Grand Game (mchezo mzuri). While each city has a prince or princess (a Poti) – this is whoever can take the title. They are subjects of Temple, and are concubines of the priestesses used to seed strength in their ranks.

 The Eastern Kombika: The Eastern Kombika are much tamer than the Western Kombika. While there are plots and squabbling for seats of power, death is not a sport…the Fiery Forest, immoparous crocodiles and storms cause enough of that. The Eastern Kombika rely on the kindness of strangers, and offer it equally. But they will destroy any who betray this trust. They live in hollowed out baobab trees that are treated with a lacquer distilled by the famous woodworker conclaves of Eastern Kombika. These conclaves and houses double up as traveler’s waypoints, and all have ample guest rooms. Drifters will often frequent these hoping to entrap others into contract. Other conclaves that are famous are the weapon smiths – while they are wooden, these weapons are stronger than any bronze and are sought all over Sarania, though are coveted by East Kombika’s own swathes of martial arts conclaves. They tend to eat animals – ones already charred by the regular forest fires here, and so the East Komika are called scavengers by their neighbors. Their cities are ruled over by councils and are made of semi-permanent structures that are erected between more permanent great baobabs that are so large they must be at least tens of thousands of years old. While tamer than their cousins, they still war regularly; when resources are low after forest fires, or when perceiving threats from neighbors.

Kombika unisex names include: Muchujubu nruhirra, Gidebuio abkeio, Aiola jajicha, Aibi uddado, Fadudu fachajza, Gecheti nareri, Aruchude ludida, Gitiyutu abjrie, Aikij boaijshi, Garadi oaedi, Muduiude hodida, Sladila isrumibuleh, Girireju mudibo, Sloichi muyoie, Abejilo yuchijre, Faduchodo mojbate, Gireyeto amdumanie, Wliked galiti, Adake ghurori, Fadaoi holochuhir, Wkatare shdira, Fechude aniari, Gikede jujeki, Feyui geyotuman, Felalidi madabo, Atai lari, Muroiuio hadate, Gijoio gebejshumi, Wchetoro amdoai, Nkakede azyumiai, Gilieti bidebo, Oaio faluhadia, Gaida fakeie, Stelu wduhadba, Fedujech feido.

Nygina: The Nygina have two rough subgroups, which are listed with descriptions in the bullet points below.

The Northern Nygina: The Northern Nygina are known as the moistened minds by others. They live in damp places, like the Wet Wood and on the shores of the great lake, in houses built in the treetops or stilts which rise from the waters. They are reclusive, and while they practice the teachings of the Temple of Saria they have strange and secret rituals and practices, which seem alien and even heretical to others. They are known to show emotion only to each other, and to the outside world they wear a faint smile, as if amused by an untold joke. They eat a variety of things, though never cooked – generally fruit and raw red meat, and enjoy drinking the blood of their pray from clay vessels. The more blood one regularly drinks, the higher their status. There are conclaves who are dedicated to the procurement and storage of good tasting blood, which has become the center of their economy. They are also famous for their conclaves of researchers, who are only rivalled by those of the myriad themselves. Northern Nygina do not have their own warders or drifters, and instead the women just take the men that they want, and any babies that are had are raised by the conclave collectively – trained on site as it were.

The Southern Nygina: The Southern Nygina are outgoing, voracious, insatiable and sensuous. 

Nygina unisex names include: Giroluya entered during ianasbzim, Gaieleku entered during sariareil, Geyuaoka born under the rianabshir, Wteli of ianre’hat, Fechoae born under the sahreem, Achadayo entered during smabeem, Aoyu from sariasblim, Schuja from rianisrmi, Ochedaji entered during sarian zlim, Geiruru entered during sarianisbil, Feyeye born under the sariahblim, Njejuyo born under the sarialu’il, Felukuia of ianjashil, Gitibi born under the sarianombman, Faieye entered during rianre’il, Mujebuya from rianre’il, Naoaidu of sarianazshir, Gidoji born under the ariannushman, Fedocha from sarianrubman, Gikiko from ariannabhad, Fedili of sabhir, Gejola of ianlurher, Feaya entered during saluzeem, Febiboche of arian sh, Giyuyu from srashir, Fejubu born under the riannurhat, Gerechio entered during sarianra’her, Atode of sarianidzman.

There are 2 subcultures within the Non Sarian culture, as is listed with descriptions in the bullet points below.

The Elenai: This culture exists in the western islands. Many of the Elenai are master seafarers. Their leaders are envious of the power of The Myriad, and so are trying to find their own way to weild magic and become the dominant force on Saria.

The Yachu: A collection of relatively primative tribes that live on the east islands. They are beginning to become more involved with the wider world. 

Yachu male names include: Pravradan, Dhalraini, Asalaesh, Sabeini, Vasuka, Adalaiya, Laval, Asachuesh, Kabvi, Hajdan, Dhwavadin, Jhabedin, Dasevi, Hacheka, Kakaka, Baval, Eshadal, Bhatriash, Dapka, Ekapriash, Arajdin, Eshatral, Hachrial, Dabiya, Dajaden, Bhajradin, Karash, Javedin, Idatrivi, Idachraish, Hakridin, Adasrash, Masuka, Atuka, Prakden, Adachdan, Adateish, Arakash, Lapini, Dachraden, Vateish.

Yachu female names include: Idachdanae, Arapriyae, Dhasivilae, Idavrieshlae, Vakiesheia, Jachudinlae, Aiavinie, Sharuvie, Maleiyaeia, Hariyaie, Charradaneia, Dhasriniae, Paruiyae, Bhataviae, Ajidinae, Ekachiviae, Bajiyaie, Rabakae, Lanidaneia, Aiaprialie, Ekaveshie, Aiapinieia, Gitalvilae, Prachdinie, Rajaishlae, Bhasradeneia, Kanudenlae, Shandaneia, Shaviashlae, Ayajedenie, Lalakaie.

There are powerful wizards known as Nomancers. Their magic is known generally as Nomancy, but there are five specific types of Nomancy, as is listed with descriptions in the bullet points below.

Modation (also known as Transmancy)

Kenisery (also known as Telemancy)

Kairosaitry (also known as Tempomancy)

Dictideography (also known as Manimancy)

Synaugatics (also known as Magimancy)

Nomancers train from a young age at a place called The Myriad. The Myriad's main rival is an organisation called Temple. They worship the Ancient Immortals.
